# Redis Connection Fix Documentation

## Problem
Your application was experiencing persistent Redis connection errors:
```
Could not connect to Redis instance: Connection closed by server. Retrying in 2 seconds...
```

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Redis Service**: The docker-compose.yml didn't include a Redis service
2. **External Redis Issues**: Connecting to external Redis at `158.220.107.177:6380` which was unstable
3. **No Connection Resilience**: Applications lacked proper retry mechanisms

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Local Redis Service
Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include:
- Redis 7 Alpine container with health checks
- Proper networking between services
- Memory limits and persistence
- Exponential backoff for connections

### 2. Updated Redis Configuration
Changed `.env` file:
```bash
# Before
REDIS_URL=redis://default:3QTRrZIT75us4wo7hUCSKk1ubie7Xw4jDtVlBD8dqhmgLLodFVzj8dLus9R1O5gp@158.220.107.177:6380/3

# After
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
```

### 3. Enhanced Connection Handling
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Improved error handling in `app.py` and `start_worker.py`
- Added connection timeouts and health checks

### 4. Added Monitoring Tools
Created `scripts/redis_health_check.py` for monitoring Redis status.

## Deployment Instructions

### For Coolify Deployment:

1. **Update your Coolify environment variables:**
   ```bash
   REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
   ```

2. **Deploy the updated docker-compose.yml** with the new Redis service

3. **Monitor deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Check Redis health
   docker exec dahopevi-api python scripts/redis_health_check.py
   
   # Monitor Redis continuously
   docker exec dahopevi-api python scripts/redis_health_check.py monitor
   ```

### Service Dependencies
The services now start in this order:
1. `redis` (with health check)
2. `api` (waits for Redis to be healthy)
3. `postiz` (waits for Redis to be healthy)

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Reliability**: Local Redis eliminates external network issues
2. **Performance**: Lower latency with local Redis
3. **Resilience**: Retry logic handles temporary connection issues
4. **Monitoring**: Health check script helps with debugging
5. **Scalability**: Redis is properly containerized and managed

## Troubleshooting

### If Redis connection still fails:

1. **Check Redis container status:**
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep redis
   docker logs dahopevi-redis
   ```

2. **Test Redis connectivity:**
   ```bash
   docker exec dahopevi-redis redis-cli ping
   ```

3. **Check application logs:**
   ```bash
   docker logs dahopevi-api | grep -i redis
   ```

4. **Run health check:**
   ```bash
   docker exec dahopevi-api python scripts/redis_health_check.py
   ```

### Common Issues:

- **Port conflicts**: Ensure port 6379 isn't used by other services
- **Memory issues**: Redis container has 256MB limit, increase if needed
- **Network issues**: Ensure all services are on the same Docker network

## Configuration Details

### Redis Container Settings:
- **Image**: redis:7-alpine (lightweight and secure)
- **Memory Limit**: 256MB with LRU eviction policy
- **Persistence**: Data stored in `redis_data` volume
- **Health Check**: Ping every 10 seconds
- **Network**: Custom bridge network for service isolation

### Connection Settings:
- **Timeout**: 5 seconds for socket operations
- **Retry**: Built-in retry on timeout
- **Health Check**: Every 30 seconds for connection validation

This fix should resolve all Redis connection issues and provide a stable, scalable solution for your application.
