# Video Renderer Fixes Implemented

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. Subtitles Showing Entire Script Instead of Line-by-Line Display
- Added `_generate_segmented_subtitles()` method that intelligently breaks text into logical chunks
- Implemented better timing estimates based on audio duration
- Now distributes subtitles evenly across the video duration
- Improved parsing of SRT files to handle multi-line subtitles
- Fixed the fallback mechanism to ensure empty captions don't break the renderer

### 2. No Transitions Between Scenes Causing Video Pauses
- Updated FFmpeg concatenation to re-encode video and audio for smooth transitions
- Modified both video and audio concatenation methods:
  - Set `acodec='aac'` instead of `c='copy'` for better compatibility
  - Maintained consistent parameters: 30fps frame rate, yuv420p pixel format
  - Added 'faststart' flag for improved streaming

### 3. Subtitles Not Working Properly With Person Images
- Improved Z-ordering with explicit layer ordering (background → captions → person overlays)
- Added `has_person_overlay` parameter to consider person overlays in caption positioning
- Increased bottom margin to prevent captions from being cut off (from height-120 to height-150)
- Optimized person overlay positioning to avoid conflicts with captions

### 4. Bottom Captions Half-Hidden
- Increased the bottom margin for captions from 120px to 150px
- Adjusted caption positioning logic to adapt to the presence of person overlays

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various text lengths:
   - Short text (1-2 sentences)
   - Medium text (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Long text (multiple paragraphs)

2. Test with different media combinations:
   - Video with just captions
   - Video with captions and person image
   - Video with captions and background music
   - Video with all elements combined

3. Test multi-scene videos to verify smooth transitions and proper caption timing

## Performance Considerations

- The re-encoding of videos during concatenation may slightly increase processing time but ensures smooth playback
- Segmented subtitles might result in slightly more subtitle entries but improves readability
- Memory usage should remain similar to before

## Future Improvements

1. Add caption styling options (font, size, background opacity)
2. Implement more advanced text chunking algorithms for subtitles
3. Add support for different caption animation styles
4. Optimize rendering pipeline for better performance
