### Content Strategy
- **Multi-Segment Benefits**: Emphasize multi-segment compilations for higher engagement
- **Transcription Quality**: Ensure good audio quality for precision timing features
- **Language Consistency**: Match TTS voice language with video content language
- **International Content**: Use native language voices for cultural authenticity

## 13. Performance Considerations

- Video upload to Gemini AI may take longer for large files but provides better analysis.
- Fallback to transcript analysis ensures reliable processing even with upload failures.
- Intelligent audio mixing adds processing time but significantly improves output quality.
- Cloud storage integration ensures scalable file handling for viral content distribution.
- Asynchronous processing via webhooks recommended for production applications.
