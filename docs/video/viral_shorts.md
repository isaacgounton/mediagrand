# Viral Shorts Generation Endpoint (v1)

## 1. Overview

The `/v1/video/viral-shorts` endpoint is a streamlined video API designed specifically for creating viral-quality short videos using advanced AI analysis. This endpoint is inspired by viral content creation best practices and focuses on generating engaging commentary-style shorts that blend original video content with AI-generated voiceover. Unlike the comprehensive `/v1/video/shorts` endpoint, this endpoint prioritizes viral content quality through visual AI analysis, intelligent audio mixing, and viral-focused script generation.

## 2. Endpoint

**URL:** `/v1/video/viral-shorts`
**Method:** `POST`

## 3. Request

### Headers

- `x-api-key`: Required. The API key for authentication.
